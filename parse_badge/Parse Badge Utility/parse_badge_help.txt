utility name : parse_badge
creator : Jason Hall - TCP Tier 1 Support Technician 325.320.1696
purpose : Useful utility for testing badge parsing

background : The parse_badge utility was created initially to help train technicians on the inner workings of badge parsing.
The utility was then modified to add the ability to generate valid parsing rules given raw badge binary and desired decimal 

usage : 
  a) basic binary to decimal conversion (no parsing rules)
    1) Fill out either the "full binary" or "binary short form entry" fields
	2) Press the appropriate button "use binary short fields" or "use full binary field" 
	3) Press the "binary to decimal" button
	4) The resulting decimal value is displayed in the "full decimal" field
	
  b) binary to decimal using the "parse then translate" method
    1) Fill out either the "full binary" or "binary short form entry" fields
	2) Press the appropriate button "use binary short fields" or "use full binary field" 
	3) Fill out the "parse start position", and "parse length" fields as desired (not required)
	4) Press the "parse then translate" button
	5) Press the "binary to decimal" button
	6) The resulting decimal value is displayed in the "full decimal" field
	
  c) binary to decimal using the "translate then parse" method
    1) Fill out either the "full binary" or "binary short form entry" fields
	2) Press the appropriate button "use binary short fields" or "use full binary field" 
	3) Fill out the "parse start position", and "parse length" fields as desired (not required)
	4) Press the "translate then parse" button
	5) Press the "binary to decimal" button
	6) The resulting full decimal value is displayed in the "full decimal" field	
	7) The parsed (final) decimal value is displayed in the "partial decimal" field
	
  d) basic decimal to binary (no parsing rules)
    1) Fill out the "full decimal" field
	2) Press the "decimal to binary" button
	3) The resulting binary value is displayed in the "full binary" field
	
  d) decimal to binary using the "parse then translate" method
    1) Fill out the "full decimal" field
	2) Fill out the "parse start position", "parse length", and "total binary bit length" fields as desired (not required)	
	3) Press the "parse then translate" button
	4) Press the "decimal to binary" button
	5) The resulting binary value is displayed in the "full binary" field

  e) generate parsing rules
    1) Fill out either the "full binary" or "binary short form entry" fields
	2) Fill out the "desired decimal" field
	3) Press the "generate parsing rules" button
	4) The parsing rules that resolve to the desired decimal (if they exist) are displayed in the "translate then parse" and "parse then translate" dropdowns respectively
